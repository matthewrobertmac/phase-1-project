      "description": "Content moderation is the process of automatically analyzing user-generated content to determine if it meets certain criteria or violates community guidelines. The process of content moderation involves training a deep neural network on a large dataset of labeled examples to recognize patterns and features within the content that are indicative of specific categories such as hate speech, nudity, or violence. Once the network is trained, it can be used to classify new content and flag any that violates the guidelines. TensorFlow JS provides pre-trained models such as Toxicity Classifier that can be used for content moderation tasks with minimal configuration. Alternatively, custom content moderation models can be trained using the TensorFlow JS API.",

The process of style transfer involves training a deep neural network on a set of images to learn the style of a particular image and then using that model to apply the style to a new image. This is achieved by optimizing the content image to match the style of the reference image while preserving the content information.
