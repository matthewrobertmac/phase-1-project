    <h1>TensorFlow.js brings machine learning to the browser</h1>

    <p>TensorFlow.js democratizes machine learning by bringing it to the browser and making it accessible to developers who work regularly with JavaScript. It enables web developers to build and train machine learning models directly in JavaScript, and use these models in web applications. One of the key benefits of TensorFlow JS is that it requires no special installation or setup and will run on any web browser.</p> 

    <p>TensorFlow.js excels in areas such as content moderation, image classification, object detection, style transfer, speech recognition, natural language processing, and more.</p>
